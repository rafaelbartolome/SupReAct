# Clean "Architecutre" and Swift 

Talk for [Vs Mobile 2016](http://www.vsmobile.tech) 11/06/2016 at Madrid (Spain) 

Small example trying to refactor a MVC (Massive View Controller) into a something like a "Clean Architecture".
Each commit is an step in the process.

### Sumary
There is no place for small apps in the stores anymore. Nowadays mobile apps development requires a great amount of time and dedication, and getting your product to market quickly with high quality is a key factor for success. So the way we build app, the way we code is changing as well and one of the deepest changes will be how we will architect our code. In this session we will review most common architectural patterns and we will try to demonstrate their benefits in practice with Swift.
